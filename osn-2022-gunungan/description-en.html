<!-- Title: Building Fruit Pile -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  At a fruit market in Pak Dengklek's hometown, there are $N$ fruit stalls located sequentially in a single row.
  The fruit stalls are numbered from $1$ to $N$ from left to right.
  Fruit stall $i$ only sells fruits of type $A_i$.
  Each fruit sold in stall $i$ has a weight of $W_i$ and a size of $V_i$.
</p><p>
  As a fruit marketing agent, Pak Dengklek wants to kickstart the fruit sales in his hometown.
  To do that, Pak Dengklek will prepare a pickup truck, then build a single fruit pile on the truck.
  Pak Dengklek plans to build the pile by using exactly a single fruit of each available type in the fruit stalls in the fruit market.
  To make it easier to record which fruits are already in the fruit pile, Pak Dengklek will buy the fruits in ascending order of type.
  In other words, Pak Dengklek will start by buying a fruit of type $1$ (if there is any), then buy a fruit of type $2$ (if there is any), and so on, for all available fruit types.
</p><p>
  Initially, Pak Dengklek chooses any stall to start his plan.
  Then, Pak Dengklek can buy fruit in that stall or move to a stall immediately adjacent to it.
  Pak Dengklek continues to do this until he finishes his plan.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek's truck has a load factor of $b$, whose value depends on the fruit pile currently on the truck.
  Initially, the value of $b$ is $1$. Each time Pak Dengklek buys a single fruit in stall $i$, Pak Dengklek's truck needs $V_i \times b$ units of energy to carry that fruit onto the top of the pile; after that, the load factor $b$ will change to $W_i \times b$.
  Pak Dengklek's truck also needs $b$ units of energy each time Pak Dengklek moves from a stall to another adjacent stall.
</p><p>
  Pak Dengklek wants to calculate the minimum total units of energy needed to finish the plan.
  Help Pak Dengklek calculate this value!
  Due to the uniqueness of Pak Dengklek's hometown, it is guaranteed that the minimum total energy needed is not more than $10^{18}$.

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p><pre>
N
A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> … A<sub>N</sub>
W<sub>1</sub> W<sub>2</sub> … W<sub>N</sub>
V<sub>1</sub> V<sub>2</sub> … V<sub>N</sub>
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
  Output a line containing an integer representing the minimum total energy needed to finish the plan.

1 1 2
5 4 5
3 2 10
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>

<pre>
46
</pre>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek can finish the plan as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pak Dengklek starts the plan from stall $2$.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $1$ in stall $2$,
    which takes $1 \times 2 = 2$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $4 \times 1 = 4$.
  </li>
  <li>Move to stall $3$, which takes $4$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $2$ in stall $3$,
    which takes $10 \times 4 = 40$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $5 \times 4 = 20$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The total energy needed by Pak Dengklek's truck to finish the plan in that way is $2 + 4 + 40 = 46$.
  There are no other ways to finish Pak Dengklek's plan with less energy.

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek can finish the plan as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pak Dengklek starts the plan from stall $5$.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $1$ in stall $5$,
    which takes $1 \times 7 = 7$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $2 \times 1 = 2$.
  </li>
  <li>Move to stall $4$, which takes $2$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $2$ in stall $4$,
    which takes $6 \times 2 = 12$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $1 \times 2 = 2$.
  </li>
  <li>Move to stall $5$, which takes $2$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>Move to stall $6$, which takes $2$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>Move to stall $7$, which takes $2$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $3$ in stall $7$,
    which takes $1 \times 2 = 2$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $2 \times 3 = 6$.
  </li>
  <li>Move to stall $8$, which takes $6$ units of energy.</li>
  <li>
    Buy a fruit of type $5$ in stall $8$,
    which takes $2 \times 6 = 12$ units of energy, and changes the load factor to $5 \times 6 = 30$.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The total energy needed by Pak Dengklek's truck to finish the plan in that way is $7 + 2 + 12 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 12 = 47$.
  There are no other ways to finish Pak Dengklek's plan with less energy.
