<!-- Title: Building Roads -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek is a foreman of road construction projects in his hometown.
  Each road consists of a gravel base paved with asphalt.	 
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek will buy the construction materials from $N$ shops, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  Each shop only sells one kind of material.
  Shop $i$ sells the materials as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If $T_i = 1$, then the shop sells gravel. One sack of gravel bought from this shop can build $A_i$ metres of gravel base for a road.</li>	 
  <li>If $T_i = 2$, then the shop sells asphalt. One sack of asphalt bought from this shop can pave $A_i$ metres of gravel base.</li>	 
</ul>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek has a unique method of building a road:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose two integers $L$ and $R$ with $1 \le L \le R \le N$.</li>
  <li>
    Buy materials from shops $L$ to $R$ sequentially.
    In shop $L$, buy at least one sack of material.
    In each of the next shops, the number of sacks bought must be strictly greater than in the previous one.
  </li>
  <li>Build the gravel base of a road with all gravels bought.</li>
  <li>
    Pave the gravel base with the asphalt bought.
    If the amount of asphalt is insufficient to pave the entire road, the remaining road segment is left unpaved.
    If there is some remaining asphalt, it will be thrown away and not be usable anymore.
  </li>
  <li>Pak Dengklek must buy the materials from the shops in such a way as to minimize the length of the unpaved road segment.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek will do $N$ road construction projects, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  In the $j$-th project, Pak Dengklek will build $j$ roads.
  Pak Dengklek will build the $k$-th road in the $j$-th project according to the method above by choosing $L = k$ and $R = j$.
</p>
<p>
  From all roads built in all projects, Pak Dengklek wants to know the total length of the unpaved road segments.
  Because this total length might be very large, Pak Dengklek only wants to know the value modulo $1\;000\;000\;007$.
  Help Pak Dengklek compute this value!
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \le N \le 100\;000$</li>

</ul>

  <li>(21 points) $N \le 400$</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9 points) $N \le 3000$</li>

<p>
  As an example, Pak Dengklek can build the $1$-st road in the $7$-th project with the following strategy.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy $1$ sack of gravel in shop $1$, which is enough for $3$ metres of road base.</li>
  <li>Buy $4$ sacks of asphalt in shop $2$, which is enough for $4$ metres of road pavement.</li>
  <li>Buy $5$ sacks of gravel in shop $3$, which is enough for $5$ metres of road base.</li>
  <li>Buy $7$ sacks of asphalt in shop $4$, which is enough for $14$ metres of road pavement.</li>
  <li>Buy $8$ sacks of gravel in shop $5$, which is enough for $8$ metres of road base.</li>
  <li>Buy $9$ sacks of asphalt in shop $6$, which is enough for $18$ metres of road pavement.</li>
  <li>Buy $10$ sacks of gravel in shop $7$, which is enough for $30$ metres of road base.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  With this strategy, Pak Dengklek obtains enough gravel to build $46$ metres of road base and enough asphalt to pave $36$ metres of gravel base.
  This way, the length of the unpaved road segment is $10$ metres, which is the shortest length possible for this road.
</p>

<p>
  As another example, Pak Dengklek can build the $2$-nd road in the $5$-th project with the following strategy.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy $2$ sacks of asphalt in shop $2$, which is enough for $2$ metres of road pavement.</li>
  <li>Buy $4$ sacks of gravel in shop $3$, which is enough for $4$ metres of road base.</li>
  <li>Buy $5$ sacks of asphalt in shop $4$, which is enough for $10$ metres of road pavement.</li>
  <li>Buy $7$ sacks of gravel in shop $5$, which is enough for $7$ metres of road base.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  With this strategy, Pak Dengklek obtains enough gravel to build $11$ metres of road base and enough asphalt to pave $12$ metres of gravel base.
  This way, there is no unpaved road segment.
  Note that the remaining asphalt is thrown away and cannot be used for another road in any project.

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>

  The following table denotes the lengths of the unpaved road segment for each road in each project.

<p>
  As an example, Pak Dengklek can build the $2$-nd road in the $2$-nd project with the following strategy.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy $1$ sack of gravel in shop $2$, which is enough for $77780$ metres of road base.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  With that strategy, Pak Dengklek obtains enough gravel to build $77780$ metres of road base and no asphalt.
  This way, the length of the unpaved road segment is $77780$ metres.
